# 🚀 Hyper Universal Space Tactics

**Hyper Universal Space Tactics (HUST)** is a 2D space shooter game built with Java, focusing on **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, **clean architecture**, and the practical application of **design patterns** in a real-time game environment.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay

* Fast-paced arcade-style shooting mechanics
* Movement using **WASD / Arrow Keys**
* Primary fire + laser skill
* Boost / dash system with cooldown
* Multiple enemy types (basic, orbit, drone, boss)
* Time-based wave spawning system
* Projectile collision handling (player / enemy / projectile)
* Explosion and death visual effects
* Smooth rendering and responsive controls
* Dynamic combat experience

## 🧠 Technical Focus

This project is designed as a **learning-oriented game system**, emphasizing:

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Abstraction
* SOLID principles

### Design Patterns

* **Singleton** – `SoundManager`, `PoolManager`, `ImageLoader`, ...
* **Factory Method** – Projectile creation
* **State Pattern** – Game states (`Menu`, `Playing`, `GameOver`, ...)
* **Strategy Pattern** – Movement behaviors (`LinearMovement`, `MoveToTarget`, ...)
* **Object Pooling** – Efficient reuse of enemies, projectiles, effects

### Game Architecture

* Custom game loop implementation
* Separation of concerns (rendering, logic, input)
* Modular and scalable system design

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Java 21 (Core / Java2D)
* Maven
* OOP principles
* Custom rendering pipeline

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

* JDK 21+
* Maven 3.8+
* Windows / Linux / macOS with display support
